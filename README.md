## Hi, I’m Petar 👋

**Software engineer based in the Netherlands**, focused on building reliable, scalable systems and turning complex problems into clean, practical solutions. I enjoy working across the stack, with a strong interest in backend architecture, system design, and performance-critical applications.

Alongside my day-to-day work, I maintain a [technical blog](https://devblog-lake-eight.vercel.app/) and a [portfolio](http://petemihaylov.xyz), where I write about the lessons learned from building production systems.

If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petar-mihaylov/).
