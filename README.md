## Hi there, I‚Äôm Petar! üëã

As a software developer based in the Netherlands, I thrive on tackling challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone. My passion lies in creating solutions that are both efficient and creative.

As a recent graduate, I am motivated to make an impact, excited about every opportunity, and eager to expand my skills. I am inspirated by the productive individuals who find courage and dedication in their craft, search for truth and excellence.
Apart from coding, I also maintain a [blog](https://blog.petemihaylov.com/categories/all) and a [portfolio](https://petemihaylov.com/). These platforms serve as a space for me to share my insights, experiences, and creative endeavors.

Let's connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petar-mihaylov/) and feel free to drop me a message.
